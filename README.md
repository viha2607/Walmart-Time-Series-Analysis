Project: Understanding and Predicting Walmart Sales through Time Series Analysis

This project delves into the dynamic world of Walmart's weekly sales, utilizing historical data to uncover hidden patterns and trends. Our focus lies in uncovering the complex interplay of factors influencing sales fluctuations, empowering Walmart with data-driven strategies for sustained growth.

Research Questions:

What factors shape weekly and monthly sales variations across stores and time periods?
Do seasonal cycles or specific events (holidays, markdowns) significantly impact sales?
Can specific features be identified as potent indicators of sales performance?
Data Source and Characteristics:

We leverage the "Walmart Time Series Sales Forecasting" dataset from Kaggle, offering real-world retail sales data and aligning perfectly with our objectives. This rich dataset contains:

Sales data: Weekly sales, date-time information
Store details: Store number, type, size
External factors: Temperature, fuel price, holidays, markdowns
Economic indicators: Consumer Price Index, unemployment rate
Features:

Over 421,500 records spanning 2010-2012
15 data columns
3 distinct datasets: stores, sales, features
Analysis Pipeline:

Dataset Loading and Exploration: Familiarize ourselves with the data, understand its structure and identify potential issues.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends, correlations, and patterns to gain insights into the data's nature.
Detailed Time Series Analysis: Conduct advanced time series analysis techniques to uncover seasonal patterns, seasonality, and stationarity.
Forecasting:
Handle missing values and outliers to prepare the data for forecasting.
Implement Gradient Boost and SVM models to predict future sales.
Expected Outcomes:

This project aims to deliver:

Deeper understanding of factors influencing Walmart's sales: Identify key factors driving sales variations and their relative impact.
Accurate sales predictions: Build robust forecasting models to anticipate future sales performance.
Data-driven strategic insights: Provide actionable recommendations for optimizing inventory management, promotions, and resource allocation.
Contributions:

This project contributes to the advancement of retail analytics by:

Exploring a real-world retail dataset with diverse features.
Implementing and comparing popular time series forecasting models.
Providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making within Walmart.
Future Extensions:

Potential future directions include:

Incorporating additional data sources: Integrate customer demographics, online sales data, etc.
Developing ensemble forecasting models: Combine multiple models for enhanced prediction accuracy.
Investigating spatial relationships: Analyze the impact of geographic factors on sales across different regions.
We believe this project's findings hold promise for empowering Walmart with data-driven strategies to navigate the dynamic retail landscape and achieve sustainable success.
